# Magisk Module YouTube Stub for YouTube ReVanced

This module has two packages.
 The first YouTube Stub package is a YouTube dummy. Gives system status to the main YouTube ReVanced app and allows overlays to be applied. This package does not need to be edited. It remains as is.

 The second YouTube Overlay package is an overlay for the main YouTube ReVanced app. With it, you can change resources (especially advanced users even styles and layouts) without violating the integrity and signature of the main YouTube ReVanced application. In addition, you do not need to edit a new version of the main application every time. We created an overlay, installed the module and it works due to a dummy in the system

 What resources can be changed:
 - Arrays
 - Booleans
 - Colors
 - Dimensions
 - Drawables
 - Integers
 - Strings
 For more advanced
 - Layouts
 - Styles
 In general, as usual in the case of overlays.
